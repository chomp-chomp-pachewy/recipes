    "title": "Ube Brûlée",
    "description": "This is a variation on the crème brûlée, Krümel's signature cookie, which features a brûléed top and vanilla cream filling. This cookie doesn't have a filling, but if you want to add one then you can, using a piping tube filled with something tasty like vanilla cream once you have finished baking. The ube is a purple sweet potato that originally hails from the Philippines and is used in desserts and baked goods. Apart from its beautiful purple colour, it also has a nutty taste rather like vanilla. After baking, sprinkle sugar over the cookies and burn it off just like you do with a crème brûlée.",

    "ingredients": [
      "150g (5½oz/⅔ cup) butter",
      "80g (2¾oz/⅓ cup plus 1 Tbsp) light muscovado sugar",
      "120g (4¼oz/½ cup plus 1½ Tbsp) caster (granulated) sugar, plus extra for burning",
      "1 egg",
      "½-¾ tsp liquid ube extract (purple sweet potato)",
      "240g (8½oz/1¾ cups) plain (all-purpose) flour",
      "3g (1 tsp) baking powder",
      "3g (1 tsp) bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)",
      "2g (⅓ tsp) salt",
      "15g (½oz/1 Tbsp) ube powder (purple sweet potato powder)",
      "70g (2½oz) white chocolate or caramelized white chocolate, roughly chopped"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Add the butter to your food processor or to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on a medium speed for 20 seconds until the butter starts to get creamy. Add both types of sugar and mix for 1½-2 minutes until the sugar is well mixed into the butter. Scrape the butter down from the sides of the bowl at 30-second intervals. The mixture should be fairly light in colour and with no visible sugar crystals.",
      "Add the egg and ube extract and mix for 20 seconds until they are just combined. Make sure you don't mix for too long - it's fine if it's still a little unmixed.",
      "Combine the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and ube powder in a separate bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture in two batches, mixing for 15 seconds between each batch until everything is just combined. Scrape the bowl between mixing. Add the white chocolate and mix briefly.",
      "Scoop 65g (2¼oz) balls of dough using an ice cream scoop, or roll balls using 2 tablespoons of dough. (Size 24 scoop is good.) There should be enough to make about 12 cookies. Place the dough balls in a container with a lid or on a tray that you then cover with cling film (plastic wrap). Leave to rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours - preferably overnight.",
      "Preheat the oven to 160°C fan (180°C/350°F/gas 4).",
      "Place the dough balls approximately 5cm (2in) apart on baking trays lined with baking parchment. Bake in the middle of the oven for 11-12 minutes. Bake one sheet at a time if not using a fan oven. The cookies should have expanded a bit, risen and begun to develop a firm but slightly glistening surface and should not have cracked.",
      "Remove the trays of cookies from the oven and leave to cool for 5 minutes. Transfer them to a cooling rack and leave to cool for at least another 10-15 minutes. Sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over the cookies and burn it using a kitchen blow torch. Allow to cool."

    "title": "Apple Rose Pie",
    "description": "Before vanilla extract was widely available, the most popular flavoring in America was rose water. This recipe brings the lovely taste of rose water back to apple pie. The traditional pie spices cinnamon and nutmeg marry well with the less-traditional cardamom, and serving this pie with a rose water-scented Chantilly cream makes it special enough for any occasion.",

    "ingredients": [
      "6 large apples, such as Granny Smith, Pink Lady, Rome, or Cameo, or a combination, cored, peeled, and thinly sliced",
      "¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar",
      "¼ cup (50 g) packed light brown sugar",
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch (1.5 cm) cubes",
      "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",
      "1 teaspoon rose water",
      "2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour",
      "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
      "¼ teaspoon ground cardamom",
      "¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",
      "½ teaspoon fine sea salt",
      "1 recipe dough for Extra-Flaky All-Butter Piecrust, chilled",
      "2 tablespoons heavy cream, for brushing",
      "1 recipe Chantilly Cream, flavored with rose water, for serving (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a large bowl, toss the apples with both sugars, the butter, lemon juice, and rose water.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, and salt. Add to the apples and toss until evenly distributed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or, preferably, overnight to release the juices from the apples.",
      "When you are ready to assemble the pie, drain the apples in a sieve set over a bowl and return them to the large bowl. Pour the liquid into a saucepan, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until it has reduced by half and become a thin gooey caramel, about 4 minutes.",
      "Pour the liquid over the apples and toss to combine.",
      "Remove the chilled disks of dough from the refrigerator. If the dough has been chilled overnight, let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before you roll it out.",
      "Lightly flour your work surface and roll out one disk of dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) round.",
      "Transfer the dough to a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish, using your fingertips to gently ease the dough into the dish, leaving a 1½-inch (4 cm) overhang all around.",
      "Roll out the second disk of dough into a 10-inch (25 cm) round and transfer it to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover both crusts with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 15 minutes.",
      "To assemble the pie: Pour the apple mixture into the prepared piecrust.",
      "Remove the top crust from the refrigerator, place on a work surface, and cut 4 to 8 vent holes in the center with a mini cookie cutter of whatever shape you like. Drape the crust over the filling and crimp the edges to seal. Decorate with the cutout pieces.",
      "Put the pie in the freezer for 15 minutes to set the crust.",
      "Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).",
      "Remove the pie from the freezer and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the entire crust with the heavy cream.",
      "Bake the pie for 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375°F (190°C) and bake for an additional 45 to 60 minutes, until the juices are bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 3 hours on a wire rack before serving.",
      "The pie can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days."
    ],
    "notes": "Note that the apples for the filling must be macerated for at least 4 hours, or, preferably, overnight. Tip: You can freeze whole fruit-filled pies or galettes to bake whenever you are ready. Cut small steam vents in the top crust of a pie before you freeze it, but wait until you are ready to bake it before you brush the pie with the egg wash. Be sure to use a metal pie dish that can go from the freezer to the hot oven."
