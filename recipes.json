    "title": "Apple Rose Pie",
    "description": "Before vanilla extract was widely available, the most popular flavoring in America was rose water. This recipe brings the lovely taste of rose water back to apple pie. The traditional pie spices cinnamon and nutmeg marry well with the less-traditional cardamom, and serving this pie with a rose water-scented Chantilly cream makes it special enough for any occasion.",

    "ingredients": [
      "6 large apples, such as Granny Smith, Pink Lady, Rome, or Cameo, or a combination, cored, peeled, and thinly sliced",
      "¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar",
      "¼ cup (50 g) packed light brown sugar",
      "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch (1.5 cm) cubes",
      "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice",
      "1 teaspoon rose water",
      "2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour",
      "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
      "¼ teaspoon ground cardamom",
      "¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg",
      "½ teaspoon fine sea salt",
      "1 recipe dough for Extra-Flaky All-Butter Piecrust, chilled",
      "2 tablespoons heavy cream, for brushing",
      "1 recipe Chantilly Cream, flavored with rose water, for serving (optional)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a large bowl, toss the apples with both sugars, the butter, lemon juice, and rose water.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, and salt. Add to the apples and toss until evenly distributed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or, preferably, overnight to release the juices from the apples.",
      "When you are ready to assemble the pie, drain the apples in a sieve set over a bowl and return them to the large bowl. Pour the liquid into a saucepan, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until it has reduced by half and become a thin gooey caramel, about 4 minutes.",
      "Pour the liquid over the apples and toss to combine.",
      "Remove the chilled disks of dough from the refrigerator. If the dough has been chilled overnight, let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before you roll it out.",
      "Lightly flour your work surface and roll out one disk of dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) round.",
      "Transfer the dough to a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish, using your fingertips to gently ease the dough into the dish, leaving a 1½-inch (4 cm) overhang all around.",
      "Roll out the second disk of dough into a 10-inch (25 cm) round and transfer it to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover both crusts with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 15 minutes.",
      "To assemble the pie: Pour the apple mixture into the prepared piecrust.",
      "Remove the top crust from the refrigerator, place on a work surface, and cut 4 to 8 vent holes in the center with a mini cookie cutter of whatever shape you like. Drape the crust over the filling and crimp the edges to seal. Decorate with the cutout pieces.",
      "Put the pie in the freezer for 15 minutes to set the crust.",
      "Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).",
      "Remove the pie from the freezer and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the entire crust with the heavy cream.",
      "Bake the pie for 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375°F (190°C) and bake for an additional 45 to 60 minutes, until the juices are bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 3 hours on a wire rack before serving.",
      "The pie can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days."
    ],
    "notes": "Note that the apples for the filling must be macerated for at least 4 hours, or, preferably, overnight. Tip: You can freeze whole fruit-filled pies or galettes to bake whenever you are ready. Cut small steam vents in the top crust of a pie before you freeze it, but wait until you are ready to bake it before you brush the pie with the egg wash. Be sure to use a metal pie dish that can go from the freezer to the hot oven."

Beat on medium-high speed until the butter is smooth and the mixture resembles wet sand, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides as needed. Continue beating on medium-high for 1 minute until the batter is light and fluffy. Add the ricotta, honey, and lemon juice. Beat on low until combined, scraping down the sides as needed. The mixture will look curdled, but don't worry!",
      "Add the flour mixture in two parts and mix on low until combined, scraping down the sides after each addition. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 30 seconds to make sure the batter is mixed.",
      "Use a 6-tablespoon cookie scoop (⅓ Cup or 2.7 ounces) to portion generous scoops of batter onto the lined baking sheets 3 inches (8 cm) apart (these cookies will spread, so give them space). Bake until the cookies are firm to the touch in the center and slightly golden on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes, switching racks and rotating halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.",
      "Make the frosting",
      "In a large bowl, combine the corn syrup, 155 grams (⅔ cup) of the heavy cream, and the vanilla. Add the powdered sugar and whisk until the frosting is smooth and very thick.",
      "Divide the frosting between two bowls. To one bowl, add the cocoa powder and the remaining heavy cream. Use a rubber spatula to mix until smooth and thick. Add more corn syrup to each bowl, a teaspoon at a time, for a glossy and spreadable consistency, if needed.",
      "Flip each cookie, flat side up. Starting with the vanilla frosting, use an offset spatula to generously frost half of each cookie, making a distinct line down the center. Clean the offset spatula, then generously frost the other half of each cookie with chocolate, maintaining a clear center line. Return to the wire rack and let set for 1 hour before serving. The frosting will become shinier as it sets.",
      "The black and white cookies can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days."

      "¼ cup cornstarch, (Cornflour in the UK (30g))",
      "2.5 cups full-fat milk, ((590ml))",

      "Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture is very thick in consistency (about 10 minutes). If you find it isn't thickening turn the heat up but keep stirring to avoid scrambling the eggs (use a whisk to get rid of any small lumps if needed).",

      "Let the mixture cool then place in the fridge until ready to use."
    ],
    "notes": "Instead of vanilla paste, you can use 1 whole vanilla pod with the inside scraped out and added to the milk (remove the pod when adding the milk to the egg) or 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Make sure the milk is not too hot when you mix it with the eggs it should be just warm to avoid scrambling the eggs. Keep the saucepan on a low heat to thicken the mixture if you turn the heat up the eggs will scramble. If you notice any unwanted lumps in your mixture whisk it using a hand whisk to smoothen it out. Use full-fat milk for best results. If you do use semi-skimmed milk it will still work but will take longer to thicken (around 15 minutes). Make sure to cover the Crema Pasticcera with plastic wrap as it cools to avoid a skin forming. Once cooled completely place it in the fridge until ready to use. The pastry cream will keep well for around 4-5 days in the fridge. I do not recommend freezing as pastry cream can split when frozen."

The ube is a purple sweet potato that originally hails from the Philippines and is used in desserts and baked goods.
