    "description": "Before vanilla extract was widely available, the most popular flavoring in America was rose water. This recipe brings the lovely taste of rose water back to apple pie. The traditional pie spices cinnamon and nutmeg marry well with the less-traditional cardamom, and serving this pie with a rose water-scented Chantilly cream makes it special enough for any occasion.",

Tip: You can freeze whole fruit-filled pies or galettes to bake whenever you are ready. Cut small steam vents in the top crust of a pie before you freeze it, but wait until you are ready to bake it before you brush the pie with the egg wash. Be sure to use a metal pie dish that can go from the freezer to the hot oven."

Make sure the milk is not too hot when you mix it with the eggs it should be just warm to avoid scrambling the eggs. Keep the saucepan on a low heat to thicken the mixture if you turn the heat up the eggs will scramble. If you notice any unwanted lumps in your mixture whisk it using a hand whisk to smoothen it out. Use full-fat milk for best results. If you do use semi-skimmed milk it will still work but will take longer to thicken (around 15 minutes). Make sure to cover the Crema Pasticcera with plastic wrap as it cools to avoid a skin forming. Once cooled completely place it in the fridge until ready to use. The pastry cream will keep well for around 4-5 days in the fridge. I do not recommend freezing as pastry cream can split when frozen."

Up until that point, I had only baked cakes with butter or vegetable oil as the given fat, yielding a completely affable but lackluster result.\nOlive oil being relegated to solely savory cooking is very American. In many parts of the Mediterranean, olive oil is a multipurpose condiment and ingredient (I cannot recommend vanilla bean ice cream with flaky salt, dark chocolate, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil enough!) that is utilized in cooking as well as baking. While olive oil cakes are nothing new and quite famous in all actuality (hello, Maialino), they are not the default cake recipe and have a fair base of naysayers who turn their noses up at the idea.\n\nThis cake is rich, moist, with a deep chocolate flavor, enhanced by coffee and vanilla. While you do not taste the olive oil directly, it is important to use an oil you personally like and whose flavor profile airs on the sweeter side. Because of the richness of this cake, I recommend pairing with a tangy or lighter frosting, or enjoying as is, with a dusting of powdered sugar and some berries.",

As it went viral globally, it became known as \u201cDubai Chocolate\u201d and inspired many to create their own versions at home. And it\u2019s easy to understand why \u2014 the confection is a dreamy combination of pistachio cream and delicate shredded phyllo encased in a snappy shell of silky chocolate. This rendition joins the many homespun recipes from near and far, and includes an exceptionally rich homemade pistachio filling with the ideal balance of salty-sweetness, and an approachable technique to tempering chocolate that anyone can accomplish. (You\u2019ll need silicone chocolate molds and a pastry brush to make this recipe; see the Tips for more details.) And while you understandably may want to keep all four bars to yourself, they do wrap up beautifully for an elegant and impressive gift.",

    "ingredients": [
      "2\u00be cups/340 grams roasted salted shelled pistachios",
      "1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar",
      "1/2 cup/120 milliliters olive oil",
      "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
      "2 teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)",
      "1 tablespoon tahini, stirred well if separated",
      "4 tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter",
      "4 cups/200 grams lightly packed roughly chopped kataifi, thawed overnight in the refrigerator if frozen (see Tips)",
      "18 ounces/570 grams chopped milk or semisweet chocolate, or 3 heaping cups chocolate chips"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make the pistachio cream: In a food processor, combine the pistachios, sugar, olive oil, vanilla and salt. Process until it becomes a creamy nut butter, stopping and scraping down the sides of the food processor with a spatula as you go to ensure a uniform mixture. The pistachio mixture will progress from chopped nuts to a thick nut paste, then finally transform into a silky, slightly thin nut butter consistency; this takes about 6 minutes.",
      "Add the tahini and process until fully incorporated, about 30 seconds more. Keep the mixture at room temperature while you make the rest of the filling.",
      "Toast the kataifi: In a large high-sided skillet or large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. When it starts to bubble, add the chopped kataifi and cook, stirring frequently and breaking up any unbrowned clumps, until it is evenly crisp and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a large plate and let cool completely, about 10 minutes. Once cooled, combine the toasted kataifi with the pistachio cream in a large bowl, mixing with a spatula until fully combined. Keep it at room temperature while you work with the chocolate.",
      "Melt the chocolate: Set a medium heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Add half the chocolate to the bowl and heat, stirring occasionally, until melted. (Alternatively, melt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, microwaving in 15-second increments and stirring well between intervals, until smooth.)",
      "Once the chocolate in the bowl is fully melted, transfer the bowl to a work surface. (Keep the pot of hot water covered in case it\u2019s needed later.) Working with a small handful at a time, begin adding the unmelted chocolate, stirring constantly until each addition is fully melted before adding more. (This process of melting chocolate and then stirring in unmelted chocolate is tempering, and is essential for creating chocolate bars with shine and snap.)",
      "Assemble the chocolate bars: Place four 6-by-3-by-1-inch silicone chocolate bar molds on a sheet pan so it\u2019s easy to transfer them in and out of the fridge. Working with one chocolate bar mold at a time, place \u00bc cup melted chocolate in a mold; using a pastry brush or the back of a small spoon, paint the inside of each mold with the chocolate, completely covering the bottom and sides. Transfer the molds to the fridge until the chocolate is hard, at least 30 minutes.",
      "Once the chocolate is fully set, remove the molds from the fridge. Divide the filling evenly among the molds (about 3/4 cup loosely packed filling per mold). Smooth the filling out with a spatula to fill the molds almost to the tops in an even layer, and transfer to the fridge until the kataifi mixture has firmed up slightly, about 10 minutes.",
      "Give the remaining melted chocolate a stir (if it\u2019s become too thick to stir, set the bowl over the pot of water over low heat, stirring until easily spreadable, or microwave in 5-second intervals, stirring in between intervals). Pour the remaining chocolate on top of the bars, dividing evenly. Using an offset spatula or the flat side of a knife, spread the chocolate out to cover the entire surface of the filling in a smooth, even layer. Scrape any excess chocolate off the tops of the molds with the spatula or knife. This will ensure clean edges on the bars when you unmold them.",
      "Return the chocolate bars to the fridge and chill until hard, 30 to 45 minutes. To unmold, gently pull the silicone away from each bar and pop them out one by one. Enjoy right away, or wrap the bars individually to keep in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. Enjoy them chilled or let them come to room temperature before snapping into one."

    "instructions": [
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be relatively soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "Once chilled, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it\u2019s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it\u2013 see me do this in the video above. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)",
      "Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.",
      "Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing or my easy glaze icing. Feel free to tint either icing with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it\u2019s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.",
      "Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": "Sugar Cookies Video Tutorial: (https://youtu.be/f24gpOgAXwY)\nFreezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes \u2013 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.\nRoom Temperature: Room temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. You can read more about it in this post. Room temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.\nFlavors: I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon. Along with lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.\nIcing: Use royal icing or my easy glaze icing. See post above to read about the differences.\nBe sure to check out my top 5 cookie baking tips AND these are my 10 must-have cookie baking tools."

      "To glaze the cookies, in a wide, shallow bowl large enough to hold all the cookies, use a whisk to stir the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together to form a thick, smooth glaze. If the glaze is too thin, add a bit more sugar. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Put all of the cookies into the glaze at once and use your hands to coat them on all sides. Transfer the cookies one at a time to the prepared baking sheets-the glaze should cling to the cookies without pooling on the sheet.

The spice blend is often used in Chinese and Vietnamese cooking and is typically made with star anise, fennel, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns.

    "notes": "Five-spice powder can be found in the spice section of most well-stocked grocery stores.\nMake Ahead\nIf wrapped tightly in plastic, the dough can be stored in the refrigerator for several days before baking. If too firm to scoop, let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes and try again.\nStorage\nStore the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.\nBlackstrap Molasses\nUsing blackstrap molasses instead of regular unsulphured molasses would significantly change the flavor and texture of these Five Spice Molasses Cookies. Here's what to expect and how you might want to adjust the recipe:\nFlavor Difference:\nBlackstrap molasses is much darker, thicker, and less sweet than regular unsulphured molasses. It has a more intense, bitter flavor with strong earthy, almost burnt undertones. This would make the cookies taste more robust, with a deeper, more intense molasses flavor.\nThe cookies would have a less sweet and potentially slightly bitter taste compared to using unsulphured molasses. The deep, complex flavors of blackstrap molasses would overpower the five-spice blend and other elements if not adjusted.\nTexture Difference:\nBlackstrap molasses is thicker and more concentrated, which could make the dough denser and the cookies chewier or harder.\nThe cookies may also spread less due to the higher concentration of sugar solids in blackstrap molasses.\nModifications:\nIncrease the sugar: To balance out the bitterness of the blackstrap molasses, you could increase the amount of sugar in the recipe. Adding an additional 1/4 to 1/3 cup of brown sugar would help counterbalance the intense, bitter flavor of blackstrap molasses.\nAdd more spices: Blackstrap molasses can overpower the spices in the recipe, so you might want to increase the five-spice powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons and perhaps add 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger or cinnamon to help bring out the spice flavors against the stronger molasses.\nReduce the blackstrap molasses: If you want to use blackstrap but still maintain a smoother flavor, you could reduce the blackstrap to 1/4 cup and add 1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup. This will balance the bitterness without losing the moisture content.\nMonitor baking time: Since blackstrap molasses may make the dough denser, check the cookies a few minutes earlier to avoid them becoming too hard. Baking for 13-15 minutes instead of 15-18 might help retain some softness.\nSummary of Modifications:\nBlackstrap molasses: Use 1/4 to 1/3 cup (instead of 1/3 cup of unsulphured) and balance with extra sugar (1/4 to 1/3 cup).\nSpices: Increase the five-spice powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons and optionally add extra ground ginger or cinnamon (1/2 teaspoon).\nAlternative sweeteners: Add 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup to balance bitterness if reducing blackstrap.\nBaking time: Reduce by a few minutes, checking around the 13-15 minute mark.\nThese adjustments should help balance the robust flavor of blackstrap molasses while keeping the cookies delicious and flavorful."
