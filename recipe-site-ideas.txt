===============================================================================
MOST ALIGNED WITH CURRENT PHILOSOPHY
===============================================================================

Given the site's manifesto about "baking as comfort," "borrowed gestures,"
and "shared community," these features would be particularly powerful:

1. RECIPE GENEALOGY
   Perfect for the "collective archive" concept. Shows how recipes travel
   through communities and evolve through shared practice.

2. RECIPE STORIES & RITUALS
   Directly supports the "Recipes & Rituals" theme. Goes beyond ingredients
   to capture the meaning and practice of baking.

3. MOOD-BASED DISCOVERY
   Embraces the "symptom of desire" idea from the manifesto. Recognizes that
   recipe search is about emotional needs, not just ingredients.

4. MINDFUL BAKING GUIDES
   Extends the "zen of baking" philosophy. Helps bakers engage with the
   meditative, transformative aspects of the practice.

5. COMMUNITY RECIPE WORKSHOP
   Enables the "exchange and variation" mentioned in manifesto. Creates space
   for collective refinement and shared wisdom.

These enhancements would deepen the site's unique philosophical approach
rather than just adding generic recipe site features.
