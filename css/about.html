        <div class="manifesto-section">
            <h2>The Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
                Baking isn't just about following recipes—it's about presence, ritual, and the quiet transformation that happens when flour becomes bread, when sugar becomes structure, when time becomes flavor.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a place for those who bake not just to eat, but to think. To notice the way dough resists before it yields. To find meditation in the rhythm of kneading. To document not just what we make, but why we make it, when we make it, how it makes us feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every recipe here carries context—the Sunday morning ritual, the late-night stress-bake, the celebration loaf. Because a chocolate chip cookie made at 2am means something different than one baked for a neighbor. The ingredients might be the same, but the intention transforms everything.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Why This Exists -->
        <section class="mt-4 mb-4">
            <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
            <p>
                Most recipe sites treat baking like a transaction: input ingredients, output dessert. But that's not how it works in real life. Baking is contextual, personal, ritualistic. It's tied to memory, emotion, and the particular texture of a Tuesday afternoon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chomp exists to preserve that context. To explore the anthropology of recipes—how they migrate, evolve, carry culture across continents. To practice mindful baking—not as a buzzword, but as a genuine practice of attention and presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't a food blog. It's a record of ritual, a meditation on process, a collection of recipes that remember their own stories.
            </p>

        <!-- The Three Pillars -->

            <h2>Three Ways of Seeing Recipes</h2>
            
            <div class="card mb-3">
                <h3>🕰️ Recipe Stories & Rituals</h3>
                <p>
                    Beyond ingredients and instructions—the <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> of baking. The Sunday morning sourdough that structures your weekend. The cookie recipe that means "I'm thinking of you." The cake that marks transitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These posts document the ritual surrounding the recipe, the context that transforms ingredients into meaning.

                <h3>🌍 Anthropology</h3>
                <p>
                    Deep dives into recipe history and cultural significance. How did this dessert cross oceans? What does it mean in its original context? How has it evolved as it traveled?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recipes are artifacts. They carry migration patterns, cultural exchange, the fingerprints of everyone who's ever made them. This is where we trace those paths.

                <h3>🧘 Mindful Baking Guides</h3>
                <p>
                    Baking as meditation. Sensory focus exercises. The zen of repetitive motion. Noticing texture changes as you knead, temperature shifts as you proof, the sound of a properly baked loaf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These guides connect technique to presence, teaching not just <em>how</em> to bake, but how to bake with full attention.

        <!-- The Approach -->
        <section class="mt-4 mb-4">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>
                Everything here is tested, photographed, and documented with the same care I'd give a friend asking for the recipe. Measurements are precise. Techniques are explained. Context is preserved.
            </p>
            <p>
                But more than that—every recipe remembers its moment. When I made it. Why I made it. What I learned. What went wrong and what went unexpectedly right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because recipes aren't static. They're living documents that evolve with each baker, each kitchen, each particular morning's humidity.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Personal Note -->
        <section class="mt-4 mb-4">
            <h2>A Personal Note</h2>
            <p>
                I started baking seriously because I needed something to do with my hands while my mind worked through problems. The rhythmic, physical nature of kneading gave my brain permission to wander, to make connections, to process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Somewhere along the way, the baking stopped being background activity and became the thing itself. The meditation wasn't happening <em>despite</em> the baking—it was happening <em>through</em> the baking.
            </p>
            <p>
                This collection is that practice made visible. Every recipe here represents hours of presence, attention, and the quiet satisfaction of making something real with your hands.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 2rem; color: #fe0032; font-weight: 500;">
                Welcome to the practice.
